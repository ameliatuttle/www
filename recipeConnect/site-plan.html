      <h3>Recipes</h3>
      <p>
        The recipes will want to fit into criteria of being cost effective, time effective, tasteful, easy, and unique. The site essentially wants to prioritize being cheap so that it is something college kids or other low-income individuals would like to use. Obviously, things that are cheaper can be harder to make good and quality so this will be important in voting. The recipes will be required to have a picture of the meal the creator took, a name, a category, hashtags, and instructions. There will be no room in a post for a personal story section like many recipes online are. This will be found on the profile if this is something the user desires. The picture will be so that the creator has verified that they made it. The name will be so that there is room for creativity. The hashtags will be so that users will be able to search for it using key words that may not relate to the name given to the recipe. The instructions will be by numbered steps and easy to follow.

      <h3>Accounts</h3>
      <p>
        The social media feature is something that will set it apart from other websites that could be similar. By adding a feature other than just blogging recipes there is an incentive to be competitive. It also makes it more likely to add more users because people often invite friends to join their favorite social sites. People love niche things on a social platform, and this is a very specific idea. It makes it more fun knowing you friends, loved ones, and general public will be able to see it. Because you will be able to personalize it like any other platform it just adds a layer of fun and ownership that makes it seem more individualized.
Users will also be able to make money on the site. Other users will be able to like or upvote and rate different recipes based on different criteria. The more votes a recipe gets, the more it will be seen. The more it will be seen the more it will have opportunity to get more votes. The more positive and overall well rated something is the more money it gets. The ratings will be in importance from cost to taste to time to ease to uniqueness. Users will then have an incentive to make better recipes that will help everyone. There could also be like a button for a tip or gratuity someone could send to the creator of the recipe if they wanted to. The money will come from advertisements from brands on the site.
